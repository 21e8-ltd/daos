Usage: $0 <path_to_duplicate>

This script replicates the Jenkins build artifacts required to build projects
based on HPDD scons_local locally.   The <path_to_duplicate> corresponds to
$CORAL_ARTIFACTS and must exist locally.  It is recommended to use a partition
with plenty of space to store several builds of various components.  Creating
a symbolic link in lieu of a real directory has not been tested.
