Overview of runtime options added by prerequisite components

Option                             Description
--update-prereq=<component>        Tells the prerequisite builder
                                   to attempt to update the repository
                                   for a prerequisite component if
                                   applicable and to check the source
                                   directory for changes.   A build is
                                   only triggered if something has
                                   changed since the last build.

--no-prereq-links                  Tells the prerequisite builder
                                   not to add links to installed
                                   prerequisite components into the
                                   PREFIX directory

PREFIX=<path>                      The installation path of the user's
                                   components.   This should be used
                                   by ENV.Install as the location to
                                   install a scons-built component.
                                   A user can do this via:
                                   ENV.Alias('install', "$PREFIX")
                                   ENV.Install("$PREFIX/bin", program).
                                   By default, prerequisites will
                                   also be installed here.   If a
                                   user specifies TARGET_PREFIX,
                                   only symbolic links for such
                                   will be installed here.

TARGET_PREFIX=<path>               An alternative location to place
                                   prerequisite builds.  If set,
                                   Each individual prerequisite
                                   component will be installed in
                                   $TARGET_PREFIX/<component> and
                                   a symbolic link to the
                                   installation targets will be
                                   placed in $PREFIX.
                                   will be installed here.

PREBUILT_PREFIX=<path>[:<path>...] If set, the directories will be
                                   searched for component builds.
                                   Each component will be found
                                   in $PREBUILT_PREFIX/<component>.
                                   If a component is missing, it
                                   will be fetched and built
                                   using the definition of the
                                   component.

<COMPONENT>_PREFIX=<path>          If set, the directory will be
                                   used as the already installed
                                   location for the component.
                                   If the location doesn't exist,
                                   the build will fail with an
                                   error.

SRC_PREFIX=<path>[:<path>...]      If set, the directories will be
                                   searched for component sources.
                                   Each component will be found
                                   in $SRC_PREFIX/<component>.
                                   If a component is missing, it
                                   will be fetched and built
                                   using the definition of the
                                   component.

<COMPONENT>_SRC=<path>             If set, the directory will be
                                   used as the already installed
                                   location for the component
                                   source.  If the location
                                   doesn't exist, the build will
                                   fail with an error.
